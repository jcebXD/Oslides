Open web slides template (Oslides)

Oslides just support at the moment four transitions:

* twister
* zoomIn
* fadeIn
* fallIn

To generate a new slide, all you have to do is modify the index.html for content and style.css for look and feel.

for example if you want to add a new slide to the template just need add this to body:

<section data-transition-in="transition">
    <div container>
        Content
    </div>
</section>

If you wanna hack, transitions are in transitions.js and the core of animation are in script.js.
